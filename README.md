# BeautifulSoup-Tests - Python

This is a Work In Progress folder I'm using for learning Beautiful Soup. 

Basically I'm trying to scrape cruise ship reviews from this site: www.cruisecritic.com, which is a rather old and messy site.

Current status: I've gotten all my data pulled down in a dictionary, but I'm having issues saving everything cleanly in a CSV. I originally was going to manage things with Pandas but I'm not sure now.
